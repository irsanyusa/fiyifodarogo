However, when confronted with an&nbsp;uncomfortable scenario, <a href=# title="red flags" data-link=tag>red flags</a> are those who exhibit a&nbsp;pattern that may be&nbsp;easily recognized and identified by&nbsp;others.</p><p><h2>1. Understanding the two sides is&nbsp;almost non-existent.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c9c/fef/c477905fffb588126fef432b39.jpg><p>The Hollywood Archive / Avalon/Photoshot/East News</p><p>If&nbsp;you know someone who is&nbsp;constantly gone when you need them and only appears when they need you, that could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;warning sign. Having <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>one-sided feelings</a> or&nbsp;concerns is&nbsp;more prevalent than you believe, but this does not mean that everyone who is&nbsp;like this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>red flag</strong>. As&nbsp;long as&nbsp;that person is&nbsp;unconcerned about your needs, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;best to&nbsp;take action.</p><p>Not because they like you or&nbsp;anything, but because they want to&nbsp;obtain something from you. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;typical life scenario, your female friend has a&nbsp;problem and has invited you to&nbsp;dine outside; it&nbsp;has been like this for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;months, only to&nbsp;tell you their issues, and when it&nbsp;is&nbsp;your chance to&nbsp;release something they have vanished into thin air.</p><p>A&nbsp;healthy relationship should be&nbsp;working in&nbsp;both ways. This applies to&nbsp;every kind, and it’s not supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;just <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>one person</a> working or&nbsp;making a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;happen. It&nbsp;should be&nbsp;balanced so&nbsp;that men and <strong>women</strong> can have a&nbsp;harmonious journey.</p><p><h2>2. Not even boundaries could stop them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e1/e49/8e086f5b34a9294fb36461960e.jpg><p>Adam Taylor/Screen Gems/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News</p><p>We&nbsp;are all aware that boundaries are something that individuals should respect, not just because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship, but also to&nbsp;demonstrate to&nbsp;others that you recognize their areas. On&nbsp;the other hand, people who are truly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>toxic</a> don’t know any private spaces. If&nbsp;that individual is&nbsp;aware that doing so&nbsp;will bother or&nbsp;harm you in&nbsp;some way and still continues to&nbsp;do, they are someone who doesn’t care in&nbsp;the first place.</p><p>That person could be&nbsp;doing it&nbsp;for a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;reasons, such as&nbsp;believing they are in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>competition</a> with you and thus need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something that will absolutely catch you off guard, or&nbsp;they simply want to&nbsp;hurt your feelings. If&nbsp;you tell them that is&nbsp;incorrect, they may even make you appear to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad person.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3d1/3a1/dd5d5e5fb18f8d5f33cd165c95.jpg><p>Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News</p><p>For example, a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;<strong>women</strong> is&nbsp;your friends, and they are really competitive in&nbsp;every way, but it&nbsp;has become a&nbsp;habit of&nbsp;theirs to&nbsp;trash talk to&nbsp;everyone, including you. Even though you are friends, that group of&nbsp;<strong>women </strong>still continues to&nbsp;talk down to&nbsp;you and disrespect your privacy, which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big <strong>red</strong> sign, and it’s too obvious to&nbsp;ignore.</p><p><h2>3. It’s all about them and only them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/14d/7dc/60f030597981cd6a84e660888d.jpg><p>Suzanne Hanover/Universal Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News</p><p>People that exhibit symptoms are constantly in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spotlight</a>. They make everything about them and tell stories about their lives, but what about you? These people even pick on&nbsp;people about their lives and how they should live them, making comments about their bodies and lifestyles without considering your sentiments.</p><p>They kept telling you to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this and that, to&nbsp;eat this and that, but after a&nbsp;while, it&nbsp;gets tiring since talking to&nbsp;them is&nbsp;like the reverse effect of&nbsp;drinking coffee in&nbsp;that they sap your vitality. Not only do&nbsp;you feel horrible about your newly purchased purse, jewelry, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;new lifestyle, but you also feel bad and upset about yourself.</p><p>Now it’s hard to&nbsp;open&nbsp;up, and we&nbsp;become insecure, which affects&nbsp;us in&nbsp;our daily lives. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign to&nbsp;walk away as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;protect your inner peace and to&nbsp;learn to&nbsp;love yourself even before. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;group of<strong>&nbsp;women</strong> with whom your buddies kept bragging about themselves all day and all night, all of&nbsp;their stories are solely about them, and they never invited you to&nbsp;share anything.</p><p><h2>4. It’s like being on&nbsp;a&nbsp;rollercoaster, but you’re stuck at&nbsp;the bottom.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e99/685/d9d9ec53de921f22159cbb13d5.jpg><p>UNIVERSAL PICTURES / Album/EAST NEWS</p><p>As&nbsp;previously stated, this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>insensitive person</a> makes everything about them so&nbsp;that they are always on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;their game. On&nbsp;the other hand, you’re stranded at&nbsp;the bottom, unable to&nbsp;move. Sometimes people adjust so&nbsp;that those around them will accept them, but it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;be&nbsp;just yourself.</p><p>As&nbsp;you progress with this person, your mental and physical health deteriorates; everything about you seems off when you’re around them. It&nbsp;will hurt, and some people are lucky enough to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;walk away from this person, but others are not; some will develop a&nbsp;new personality against their will, but they do&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;impress others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e4/2a3/95d4705da68e5884e6501174f8.jpg><p>Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News</p><p>These new habits are bad if&nbsp;you are doing something that you are not comfortable with, and you know that it’s wrong. But still, because of&nbsp;the judgments and insensitive comments, it’s hard to&nbsp;be&nbsp;yourself, especially if&nbsp;you are surrounded by&nbsp;people that don’t care about what they are saying. As&nbsp;an&nbsp;example, you are with a&nbsp;few <strong>women</strong> who are your friends, but because you dress differently, they make comments about it&nbsp;until it&nbsp;became a&nbsp;habit to&nbsp;please them, which is&nbsp;unhealthy.</p><p><h2>5. You are their personal diary.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7af/5c2/65845753d7af43d3530abdab1f.jpg><p>Francois Duhamel/Everett Collection/East News</p><p>Being toxic does not discriminate between men and <strong>women</strong>, some <strong>friendships</strong> are diverse, and it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;anyone. These are the types of&nbsp;people who maintain you as&nbsp;their own <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>personal diary</a>, where they talk about their lives and troubles and complain about you or&nbsp;them. It&nbsp;could be&nbsp;because you aren’t enough for them or&nbsp;aren’t listening to&nbsp;them, but one thing is&nbsp;certain: everything about you is&nbsp;questionable in&nbsp;their eyes.</p><p>It’s all about your flaws, despite the fact that you’ve done so&nbsp;much that they either don’t care or&nbsp;are just that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>insensitive</a>. They treat you as&nbsp;if&nbsp;you were their private therapist, and you are just allowed to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;them. You act like a&nbsp;journal, knowing exactly what they are experiencing but unable to&nbsp;say anything because they would attack you if&nbsp;you said anything.</p><p>Your role is&nbsp;to&nbsp;act like a&nbsp;mime, mute but present. It’s just a&nbsp;cruel thing to&nbsp;do, especially when you consider them a&nbsp;friend, but they don’t treat you like one, making the pain one-sided as&nbsp;well.</p><p><h2>6. Their responsibility is&nbsp;not actually theirs.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cfc/6db/c4c1525cc7bee1332fce2cce95.jpg><p>Richard Cartwright/Universal Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News</p><p>These people despise accepting <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>responsibility</a> for their actions unless they are caught red-handed, in&nbsp;which case they will most likely talk you out of&nbsp;it. They will do&nbsp;anything to&nbsp;evade accountability because they lack self-awareness and hence are unaware that what they are doing is&nbsp;actually detrimental to&nbsp;others.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, this will lead to&nbsp;a&nbsp;very unhealthy friendship with them, and it’s difficult if&nbsp;someone can accept their faults because you’ll keep adjusting for them until you are effected, which can all come crashing down in&nbsp;one snap.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Walk away or&nbsp;talk with them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d6f/493/cf6b0f51d3ae3aaf9f8d6d345e.jpg><p>Image supplied by Capital Pictures/EAST NEWS</p><p>These toxic people won’t stop until you do&nbsp;something. They will break and hurt you until they are satisfied. That’s how <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>competitive</a> and selfish they are, it’s all about their lives and never yours to&nbsp;begin with. People like this would do&nbsp;whatever, even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;negatively impacts you, to&nbsp;maintain their positive reputation and image in&nbsp;the eyes of&nbsp;others.</p><p>You can either leave or&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;them about their situation and your feelings. It’s never too late to&nbsp;say something to&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend, even if&nbsp;that buddy is&nbsp;someone everyone should avoid, but that doesn’t imply it&nbsp;will always be&nbsp;that way. To&nbsp;some extent, be&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend to&nbsp;them; if&nbsp;it&nbsp;becomes too much, break and walk away from them. Some <strong>friendships</strong> are meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;broken in&nbsp;the end, to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;grow and love oneself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/004/388/ce589a5476802ef77bebd11a4e.jpg><p>A&nbsp;Reddit user also gave useful advice on&nbsp;a&nbsp;question about red flags that most people brush aside:</p><ul><li>Friends that always say, “I&nbsp;miss you.” But when you try to&nbsp;plan something with them, they never actually seem to&nbsp;want&nbsp;to. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Teddylina&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>And we&nbsp;stumble upon a&nbsp;Redditor who shared their toxic friendship story and broke free of&nbsp;that relationship:</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;was best friends with someone for 12&nbsp;years, and we&nbsp;did everything together. Well, everything that she wanted. It&nbsp;was always about her and her schedule; she never compromised for&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;every event she had, even her parents anniversary dinner.<br>One year, my&nbsp;mother had just passed away, and&nbsp;I was home alone. I&nbsp;asked her to&nbsp;come over, and she said she was going to&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend’s house to&nbsp;party because she broke up&nbsp;with her boyfriend. We&nbsp;haven’t spoken to&nbsp;each other in&nbsp;probably 2&nbsp;years, and I’ve never been happier. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>oskatuna&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>The type of&nbsp;friendship mentioned above can be&nbsp;counted as&nbsp;a&nbsp;toxic relationship as&nbsp;they only see other people as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>means</a> to&nbsp;reach their goals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZINustGinKeco522sXnRnptmnpyWtLR5l2lubmpjZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f6-friendship-red-flags-807523.html&text=Watch%20Out%20for%20These%206%20Red%20Flags%20to%20Avoid%20Potentially%20Toxic%20Friendship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f6-friendship-red-flags-807523.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f6-friendship-red-flags-807523.html&title=Watch%20Out%20for%20These%206%20Red%20Flags%20to%20Avoid%20Potentially%20Toxic%20Friendship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f6-friendship-red-flags-807523.html&title=Watch%20Out%20for%20These%206%20Red%20Flags%20to%20Avoid%20Potentially%20Toxic%20Friendship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f6-friendship-red-flags-807523.html&title=Watch%20Out%20for%20These%206%20Red%20Flags%20to%20Avoid%20Potentially%20Toxic%20Friendship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f6-friendship-red-flags-807523.html&description=Watch%20Out%20for%20These%206%20Red%20Flags%20to%20Avoid%20Potentially%20Toxic%20Friendship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./april.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened on April 29, 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./les-deputes-adoptent-lacte-i-du-grand-paris.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Les dputs adoptent l'acte I du Grand Paris">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
