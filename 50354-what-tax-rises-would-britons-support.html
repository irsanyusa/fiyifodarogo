But to stay within Labour campaign promises, any tax increases cannot include those on ‘working people’ – VAT, income tax and national insurance. So which taxes, if any, would Britons support Reeves increasing?</p><p data-block-key=c8sbt>Although <a href=#>the public agree</a> – by 58% to 20% – with the government’s argument that cuts in spending are necessary, they are more hesitant when it comes to tax increases. Only one in seven Britons (15%) think increasing taxes is the right thing to do at the present time, with four in ten (41%) believing they should be kept at their current level and three in ten (29%) saying they should be reduced.</p><p data-block-key=8eg11>Even among those who voted for the government in last month’s election, support for general tax rises stands at just 24%.</p><p data-block-key=8vjtv>Of course, ‘tax’ is not a single thing and the public hold distinct views about different kinds of tax, including whether they are fair or should be raised or slashed. Indeed, while only 15% of Britons favour broad-strokes tax rises, four in ten (41%) think increasing taxes other than the three excluded by Reeves during the campaign (VAT, income tax and national insurance) would be the right thing to do, including two-thirds of Labour voters (65%).</p><p data-block-key=8sbmo>Considering specific taxes individually shows that the majority of Britons would be happy for two taxes to rise – 58% support an increase in the top rate of income tax and 56% favour an increase in corporation tax. Four in ten Britons (41%) also support increasing capital gains tax, slightly more than the 35% who would oppose such a rise.</p><p data-block-key=7jf41>For other major taxes, only a minority of Britons would support their increase. Against the 36% who would be happy with an increased higher rate of income tax, half of Britons (49%) would oppose such a hike. Only 27% would be supportive of a higher inheritance tax, while between just one in six and one in five Britons (17-21%) would support increases to national insurance, stamp duty or fuel duty.</p><p data-block-key=e2eil>The least popular increases would be to council tax or VAT, supported by just one in eleven (9%), and the basic rate of income tax, with only 13% of the public favouring an increase.</p><p data-block-key=7j5c7>Although there is a clear partisan component in attitudes to tax levels – Labour voters being consistently more supportive of increasing a tax than Conservatives – even on the right of centre many voters support increasing two taxes in particular.</p><p data-block-key=6f9i7>Half of Conservative and Reform voters (48%) support increasing the top rate of income tax, against around four in ten opposing (40-44%). The two groups of voters break more evenly when it comes to corporation tax – Conservatives splitting 42% to 43% for and against an increase, while Reform voters divide 43% either way.</p><h3 id=why-are-some-tax-rises-more-popular-than-others data-block-key=no3h5>Why are some tax rises more popular than others?</h3><p data-block-key=f7kvg>Central to attitudes towards tax rises are perceptions about the taxes themselves – particularly who pays them and whether they come across as fair.</p><p data-block-key=dp4da>The three taxes that more Britons support increasing than oppose – the top rate of income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax – are all ones in which very few report paying them in the last year (2-4%) and which are overwhelmingly viewed as taxes that don’t apply to most people. Only one in six (16%) say capital gains tax applies to most people, one in eight (12%) view corporation tax as applying to the majority and just 7% believe the top rate of income tax widely applies.</p><p data-block-key=b4f03>By contrast, the three tax increases most uniformly opposed are those which apply to most people. Nine in ten Britons (89-92%) correctly state that the basic rate of income tax, council tax, and VAT apply to most people, with more of the public reporting paying them than any other tax – two-thirds (66%) saying they have paid basic rate income tax in the last year*, three-quarters (74%) saying they have paid VAT and eight in ten (80%) council tax.</p><p data-block-key=7rsns>In short, people generally support increasing taxes they won’t have to pay, particularly those that apply mainly to the rich. This fits with a wider perception that the rich aren’t paying their fair share, a <a href=#>YouGov tracker from June</a> showing two-thirds of Britons (66%) feel the rich are not paying enough tax, compared to one in five (21%) saying that the rich are paying about the right amount and just 4% feeling the rich are paying too much in tax and should have their taxes cut.</p><p data-block-key=1vita>However, this relationship is not perfect. Even though extremely few people (2%) say they have paid inheritance tax in the last year, less than half of Britons (46%) perceive it as a tax that only richer people pay, with four in ten (40%) believing it applies to most people. In reality, <a href=#>less than 4% of estates are currently affected by inheritance tax</a>. Yet this perception of it applying more widely than it does, as well as <a href=#>fewer than a quarter of Britons (23%) viewing it as fair</a>, is likely why fewer people want to see it increased than other ‘rich people’ taxes.</p><p data-block-key=493ok><i>* This closely lines up with</i> <a href=#><i>data from the Institute for Fiscal Studies</i></a><i>, which shows 64% pay the basic rate, 12% the higher rate and 2% the top ‘additional’ rate of income tax.</i></p><p data-block-key=5oob1><a href=#><b>See the full results here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=cge2t>How do you feel about taxation, the economy in general, and everything else?
