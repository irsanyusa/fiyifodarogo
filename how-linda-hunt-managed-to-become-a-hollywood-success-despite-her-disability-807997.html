While some stars only have to&nbsp;show their talent to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;<a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>, Linda’s efforts had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;much bigger, so&nbsp;everyone would accept her just the way she was. She had to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;deal with despair and disappointment, but the fact that she never settled for less helped her become the star she is&nbsp;today.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> love to&nbsp;watch Hunt in&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a>, and finding out about her journey made&nbsp;us love her even more.</p><p><h2>Linda’s childhood was difficult, but thanks to&nbsp;her parent’s encouragement, she managed to&nbsp;rise above every obstacle.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/99c/31f/46b9b059c0bb3d5606063f7967.jpg><p>When Hunt was only 6&nbsp;months old, her parents noticed that something about her was different. Her motor development was slow, and when her mother took her to&nbsp;the hospital, they said that Linda had a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>congenital hypothyroidism</a>, and eventually she would have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;institutionalized.</p><p>Instead of&nbsp;accepting this prognosis, Linda’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mother</a> decided to&nbsp;beat the odds and began working with her every day on&nbsp;strengthening her motor skills. Hunt improved dramatically by&nbsp;the time she started school, but she was still different from her peers and didn’t fit&nbsp;in. Even from the first day of&nbsp;school, she experienced isolation and estrangement, and one of&nbsp;her teachers made her feel uncomfortable. “Everybody either wanted to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;me&nbsp;or&nbsp;push me&nbsp;around, you know?” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;was teased a&nbsp;lot.”</p><p><h2>Linda feared that her condition would limit her acting opportunities.</h2></p><p>“I&nbsp;knew&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;act at&nbsp;an&nbsp;early age. I&nbsp;didn’t realize how difficult it&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;be,” Hunt <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> for a&nbsp;newspaper in&nbsp;1991. It&nbsp;all started when she was 8&nbsp;years old, when she saw a&nbsp;stage performance of&nbsp;<i>Peter Pan</i> in&nbsp;the theater. She realized she wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that too&nbsp;— to&nbsp;have the power to&nbsp;make others believe what was in&nbsp;her mind. And when she revealed her interest to&nbsp;her parents, they hired voice and acting coaches, and then sent her to&nbsp;the Goodman School of&nbsp;Drama in&nbsp;Chicago.</p><p>That’s when her doctor discovered that she, in&nbsp;fact, didn’t have congenital hypothyroidism but hypopituitary dwarfism&nbsp;— a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>condition</a> where the pituitary gland doesn’t release enough growth hormone. She was 4’9″ and weighed only 80&nbsp;pounds, and for 10&nbsp;years, she tried various treatments and medications to&nbsp;improve her condition, but unfortunately, they didn’t work.</p><p>During her studies, her professors encouraged her to&nbsp;pursue directing instead of&nbsp;acting because they felt that, due to&nbsp;her condition, as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress, she would have a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hard</a> time making a&nbsp;living.</p><p><h2>After graduating in&nbsp;her early 20s, Hunt moved to&nbsp;New York to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;career.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/30b/766/cd137055bebe77c9c5f5d1fc9d.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;was very young and very lost. I&nbsp;didn’t even attempt to&nbsp;act professionally. That would’ve meant getting an&nbsp;agent and going on&nbsp;auditions. I&nbsp;wasn’t capable of&nbsp;doing any of&nbsp;that. It&nbsp;was truly emotionally beyond&nbsp;me,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>.</p><p>Thankfully, Linda had a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;friends who helped and gave her moral support. She found a&nbsp;job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;stage manager for small theaters off-Broadway. But, even after 3&nbsp;years of&nbsp;working, she hadn’t managed to&nbsp;leave a&nbsp;mark and started to&nbsp;doubt herself.</p><p>She then moved back to&nbsp;her parents’ house, and that’s when everything changed.</p><p><h2>Linda decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;doing what she loves&nbsp;— ACTING.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a86/84e/4425af56fdaa41991eb1f77257.jpg><p>While she was staying with her parents, her acting coach reminded Linda about the importance of&nbsp;acting in&nbsp;her life and the fact that that’s her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talent</a>. “I&nbsp;had lost myself for a&nbsp;while, and that awareness gave me&nbsp;back to&nbsp;myself.” Soon she started reading for parts and sending out resumes.</p><p>She made her professional debut in&nbsp;<i>Hamlet</i> and in&nbsp;the following 2&nbsp;years, she appeared in&nbsp;several more plays. Then one day, Linda received a&nbsp;call from her agent, saying that director <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Peter Weir</a> was looking for someone to&nbsp;play the role of&nbsp;Billy Kwan (a&nbsp;half-Asian male photographer with dwarfism) in&nbsp;the movie <i>The Year of&nbsp;Living Dangerously</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b09/9a6/fdd2135d6c90ec712edf5ccd9f.jpg><p>MGM/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News</p><p>“I&nbsp;met the casting director and said, ’You are going to&nbsp;rewrite the male part for a&nbsp;woman, right?’ And he&nbsp;said, ’No.’ I&nbsp;laughed. It&nbsp;was so&nbsp;wonderfully preposterous,” Linda <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>.</p><p>But after she met with Peter, she realized she had to&nbsp;take the part. “It&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;those absurd moments in&nbsp;life when you have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;forward into a&nbsp;situation that makes no&nbsp;sense.” Even though it&nbsp;might’ve looked like nonsense to&nbsp;her at&nbsp;the time, this role helped her talent fulfill its full potential, and she became the first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>person</a> to&nbsp;win an&nbsp;Oscar for playing a&nbsp;character of&nbsp;the opposite sex.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bac/02c/79a80c52b18d4131f27bc4d0db.jpg><p><h2>But, even after winning an&nbsp;Academy Award, Linda’s life didn’t change, and it&nbsp;didn’t propel her to&nbsp;the top as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;she wanted.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/558/816/2014b55fd498e934b6138c13d9.jpg><p>Hunt managed to&nbsp;land several title roles in&nbsp;theater, but in&nbsp;films, she had to&nbsp;settle for supporting roles only. “I&nbsp;am working more than&nbsp;I thought I’d be. I&nbsp;am not working as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;I’d like. I&nbsp;am still feeling enough frustrations about my&nbsp;life and my&nbsp;career that I&nbsp;am in&nbsp;analysis now&nbsp;— but not forever. I&nbsp;go into moments of&nbsp;total despair and darkness. Thankfully, I&nbsp;believe there are always answers,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;candid interview.</p><p>Even though, back then, her career didn’t skyrocket as&nbsp;she expected, today she is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most recognizable characters in&nbsp;Hollywood. Throughout her career, she appeared in&nbsp;movies such as&nbsp;<i>Dune</i>, <i>Kindergarten Cop</i>, <i>Dragonfly</i>, and more. She also had a&nbsp;successful career in&nbsp;voice-over work and television, notably being the&nbsp;TV series <i>NCIS: Los Angeles</i>, for which she has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>received</a> 2&nbsp;Teen Choice Awards.</p><p>After all, Linda Hunt proved that with a&nbsp;positive attitude, hard work, and dedication everything is&nbsp;possible.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think that it&nbsp;would have been easier for Linda to&nbsp;succeed if&nbsp;she’d started a&nbsp;career in&nbsp;today’s world and not in&nbsp;the ’70s?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4yloKeckWK1trrTZqSappGcsqV506hkm52TpLqmecBmn6iknK7EsLvDZqqum5OawLR5w56qqaGkmnqpsdFmm6KrkZe2rbXTsmRxaGduhnh7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-linda-hunt-managed-to-become-a-hollywood-success-despite-her-disability-807997.html&text=How%20Linda%20Hunt%20Managed%20to%20Become%20a%20Hollywood%20Success%20Despite%20Her%20Disability&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-linda-hunt-managed-to-become-a-hollywood-success-despite-her-disability-807997.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-linda-hunt-managed-to-become-a-hollywood-success-despite-her-disability-807997.html&title=How%20Linda%20Hunt%20Managed%20to%20Become%20a%20Hollywood%20Success%20Despite%20Her%20Disability" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-linda-hunt-managed-to-become-a-hollywood-success-despite-her-disability-807997.html&title=How%20Linda%20Hunt%20Managed%20to%20Become%20a%20Hollywood%20Success%20Despite%20Her%20Disability" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-linda-hunt-managed-to-become-a-hollywood-success-despite-her-disability-807997.html&title=How%20Linda%20Hunt%20Managed%20to%20Become%20a%20Hollywood%20Success%20Despite%20Her%20Disability" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-linda-hunt-managed-to-become-a-hollywood-success-despite-her-disability-807997.html&description=How%20Linda%20Hunt%20Managed%20to%20Become%20a%20Hollywood%20Success%20Despite%20Her%20Disability" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./le-senat-fait-40-propositions-pour-une-politique-nationale-des-mna.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Le Snat fait 40 propositions pour une politique nationale des MNA">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dan-lin-netflix-film-chief-scott-stuber-1235925576.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dan Lin to Replace Scott Stuber as Netflix Film Chief">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
