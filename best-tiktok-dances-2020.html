Pair the right shimmies and gestures with an earworm of a music clip and you could find yourself being mimicked by millions of other TikTok users who are eager to learn a new dance routine—<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">or just trying to get some movement in while staying home.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the power of a trending dance extends beyond the views of a viral video; this year so far, TikTok dance challenges were responsible for securing top chart spots for artists like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Doja Cat</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Megan Thee Stallion</a>, whose songs provided the addictive soundtracks for these dance trends. For Drake, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">no stranger to the potential of a viral challenge</a>, having the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“Toosie Slide” hit #1 on the Billboard Top 100 appeared to be a clever feat of reverse engineering</a>, thanks to his instructive lyrics that were perfect for a soundbite, and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“leak”</a> of a hip hop dancer-slash-influencer performing choreography to it. The dance challenge began before the song had even dropped.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other artists have acknowledged the power of the TikTok dance as well; Doja Cat included Haley Sharpe, the TikTok user who created the viral choreography to her song “Say So,” in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the official music video</a> for the track, while Cardi B has vowed to learn the choreography to the <a href=# rel=noopener>dance challenge</a> that choreographer Brian Esperon debuted on TikTok to her song “WAP” with Megan Thee Stallion. (Since the song released two weeks ago, “WAP” has been used as the audio for just under 200,000 videos on the app, while the hashtag #WAPdance has amassed over 2.7 million views.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So, while the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump Administration has issued executive orders that some fear could lead to the app getting banned in the United States</a>, it appears that for now the TikTok dance challenge is here to stay. From the Renegade to the WAP challenge, here are the best TikTok dances of the year and how they took over the Internet.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Renegade with “Lottery (Renegade)” by K Camp</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Consider the Renegade the dance routine that introduced TikTok dances to the mainstream. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times reported</a> in February that the wildly popular version of the dance that was circulating on TikTok was taken, without credit, from a 14-year-old dancer named Jalaiah Harmon, who had posted the original and more complex routine on an app called Funimate. The dance’s viral popularity brought issues with crediting and influencer culture—especially when it comes to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">taking (and benefiting from) content made by Black creators</a>—to the forefront of Internet discussion.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">“Blinding Lights” by The Weeknd</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Weeknd’s ’80s-flavored hit “Blinding Lights” inspired <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok user @gregdahl7 to create a challenge</a> in its name, which involves a group of people dancing with sweeping arm movements. Unlike other TikTok challenges, this one tends to involve more space and movement, as it begins with a run into the frame and ends with a jump.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">“WAP” by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While there are multiple dances that have been choreographed for Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s late-summer hit “WAP,” the routine that begins with a high kick, twerking and falling into the splits—<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created by choreographer Brian Esperon</a>—is the one that’s Cardi-approved and has found fans among influencers like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dance Moms star Nia Sioux</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">“Tap In” by Saweetie</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok user Lesley Gonzalez</a> is credited with creating the choreography for the “Tap In” dance, which begins with a literal interpretation of the song’s title. The dancer first “taps” the air like a phone screen, then launches into a series of flashy upper-body dance moves and body rolls.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">“Say So” by Doja Cat</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">17-year-old Haley Sharpe created this quick routine</a> filled with arm rolls and punches in her bathroom, she helped to catapult Doja Cat’s song “Say So” to both TikTok fame and the top of the charts. Sharpe’s influence didn’t go unacknowledged either; Doja had the teenager appear in the ’70s-themed official music video for the song, where Sharpe performed the routine while roller skating at a disco rink.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">“3 Musketeers” by ppcocaine ft. NextYoungin</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Magazine</a>, the body roll-heavy dance routine that’s become synonymous with ppcocaine’s song “3 Musketeers” was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created by TikTok user @colo.cag</a>. The choreography is punctuated with lots of chest pops and hip thrusts, which makes it a great match for the energetic, if chipmunk-esque, vocals from ppcocaine (formerly known as trapbunniebubbles).</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Savage Challenge with “Savage” by Megan Thee Stallion</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Megan Thee Stallion dropped her EP SUGA in March, her song “Savage” became a hit on the Internet, where fans particularly loved the hook that described Meg as “classy, bougie, ratchet.” TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keara Wilson created a dance routine</a> with demonstrative movements for each of those descriptors that was so captivating that Meg not only reposted Wilson’s video, but also uploaded a video of herself doing the choreography.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">“Cannibal” by Kesha</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kesha’s old music—party anthems ripe with hyperbole and debauchery—make for TikTok gold: since the dances that trend on the app do well with literal interpretations, the more dramatic the lyrics, the better. So perhaps it should come as no surprise that Kesha’s song “Cannibal” has become a viral hit on TikTok nearly a decade after its release. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">routine created by user Briana Hantsch</a> features a dance move of pretending to eat alongside the line “I’ll eat you up,” and became so popular online that Kesha herself released a video of herself doing the dance online, alongside TikTok super-influencer Charli D’Amelio.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">“Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat)” by Jawsh 685 and Jason Derulo</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Singer and burgeoning TikTok influencer Jason Derulo has made no secret of his love for the app, using it to boost the release of his song “Savage Love” in June and using TikTok videos of influencers and celebrities dancing to the track as the official music video. The release did came with some controversy, however; Derulo was called out for using Joshua Styla’s “siren jam” beat (which had found popularity on TikTok earlier) in a sneak-peek snippet, without crediting him or clearing its use. Styla, a Polynesian 17-year-old living in New Zealand, had created the beat to pay homage to his Samoan and Cook Island heritage; while Styla later received song credit, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, he was in the middle of label discussions and conversations about artists he might collaborate with (including Derulo), when Derulo leaked the song.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Do I Have Your Attention Challenge with “Attention” by Todrick Hall</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This dance challenge is for the flexible among us; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">started by user Alejandro Santos</a>, it consists of gymnastics-inspired moves, with many people hitting feats like kicks, splits and back handsprings to the high energy of Todrick Hall’s track “Attention.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">“Vibe (If I Back It Up)” by Cookiee Kawaii</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As far as dance routines go, this might be one of easiest ones to hit TikTok. Users can basically freestyle “throwing it back” as they see fit, as long as movements coincide with the quirky sound effects (a whip crack and sea gulls squawking) in the Cookiee Kawaii track.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">“Supalonely” by BENEE ft. Gus Dapperton</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The “Supalonely” dance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created by user Zoi Lerma</a>, is a study in telling a narrative through dance. Consisting of mostly sweeping upper-body moves, the choreography mimes actions like “drinking” and “thinking” to match BENEE’s lyrics about feeling, well, “super lonely.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">“Get Loose” by Huncho Da Rockstar & KBlast</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The “Get Loose” dance challenge was inspired by the TisaKorean music video for the song of the same name by Huncho Da Rockstar and KBlast. In the video, the artists stand in a triangle formation, stepping forward and back as they twirl one of their arms, before jumping in unison. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, the dance challenge on TikTok started after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">user Taydon Smith recreated the dance</a> in a video on the app, staggering his movements with his friends.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">“Why Is Everything Chrome (Lean Swag Rock Wit It)” by King Critical</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The dance created to accompany a clip from King Critical’s song “Why Is Everything Chrome?” has become one of the most popular routines on the app, with even Justin and Hailey Bieber giving it a try. The moves are drawn fairly directly from the lyrics, relying on the interpolation of “Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It” along with some well-placed hip sways.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Ahi Challenge and TraChallenge2 with “Tra Tra” by Nfisis</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oprah Magazine</a>, the original “Ahi” challenge was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created by TikTok user @elrodcontreras</a>, who choreographed a simple routine in which users sway their hips and raise their hands to the beat of the song “Tra Tra” by Nfisis. A later challenge, called the “Tra Challenge 2” kept most of the same movements and the same music.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Hit Every Beat challenge with “U Can’t Touch This” by MC Hammer</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This TikTok dance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created by user Thaddeus William-Coates</a>, is a riff on the Macarena, set to a remix of MC Hammer’s classic track, “U Can’t Touch This.” Simply align your Macarena movements to the beats that follow Hammer saying “can’t touch this,” before adding a drumming motion and the “woah” at the end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZucGhlhHiFjpucrKxdqbaswM6kZJ2ZnpiytHmRaWlpZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-tiktok-dances-2020.html&text=Best%20TikTok%20Dances%20of%202020%20So%20Far&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-tiktok-dances-2020.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-tiktok-dances-2020.html&title=Best%20TikTok%20Dances%20of%202020%20So%20Far" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-tiktok-dances-2020.html&title=Best%20TikTok%20Dances%20of%202020%20So%20Far" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-tiktok-dances-2020.html&title=Best%20TikTok%20Dances%20of%202020%20So%20Far" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-tiktok-dances-2020.html&description=Best%20TikTok%20Dances%20of%202020%20So%20Far" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./espace-economique-telecentre-de-lapalisse-03.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Espace conomique tlcentre de Lapalisse (03)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./150-millions-supplementaires-daide-aux-departements.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="150 millions supplmentaires d'aide aux dpartements">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
