The answer is yes. Unrequited love is hard enough, even more so if the person of interest offers you just friendship. The reality that your feelings are not reciprocated with the waited-for echo hurts deeply. Luckily, there are workable tactics to get out of the friend zone territory and enter the romantic zone.</p><h2>How to get out of the friend zone</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/19bfe72aa0770800.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ love memes for every occasion to send to your significant other</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The friend zone exists, and breaking free from it can be one of the most difficult experiences you'll ever have in a relationship. Here are 27 strategies for breaking out of the friend zone.</p><h3>1. Flirt with your crush</h3><p class=align-left>When you like your friend, one big question that comes to your mind is how to escape the friend zone. Flirting is the fastest way to get out of the friend zone. Send your crush a <a href=#>flirty message</a> that will surprise them.</p><p class=align-left>Texting them something pleasantly unexpected will surprise them and can change the way they see you. They stop thinking of you as a just friend and see you as a potential dating mate. Flirting can be done by sending flirty texts and talking in a flirty way.</p><h3>2. Become mysterious</h3><p class=align-left>Be a little mysterious and spice the friendship by acting differently once in a while. You can also avoid texting and calling when they expect, making them curious.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/2f67e6e919d0f2c9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top flirty memes to send your partner when bored</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Instead, keep them intrigued and let them want to know what you are up to. This will create interest, and who knows who, this might be a start of a great romance.</p><h3>3. Make them a little jealousy</h3><p class=align-left>If you are wondering how to get out of the friend zone with a girl you like, make her jealous. Girls quickly fall prey to the green-eyed monster when it comes to matters of the heart.</p><p class=align-left>Hang around people of the opposite s*x and tell them you have been having fun. Have fun with other people and show them that you have a life beyond them. A little competition and jealousy will make them eager to spend time with and have your affection.</p><h3>4. Tell the truth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/19bfe72aa0770800.jpeg><p class=align-left>The truth will always set you free. But when it comes to matters of the heart, confessing may be one of the hardest things to do. It requires a lot of courage on your side, but at least you will get a straight answer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/008a982bfe9f8bcf.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>35 best Tinder openers nobody will ever dare to swipe left on</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Get into some real talk since you are already friends and talk about many things together.

On the other hand, prepare for the worst since they may not have the same feelings.</p><h3>5. Stop acting like a friend</h3><p class=align-left>Stop acting like just a friend if you want a <a href=#>romantic relationship</a>. That means no more teasing him too much, using a casual name, and not dressing up when you are together. Instead, change how they see you and look like a potential romantic partner.</p><h3>6. Don't show relationship signals too early</h3><p class=align-left>If you want to know how to get out of the friend zone with a guy, don't show your interest too early.

Throw in compliments, and you'll definitely see a <a href=#>change in the relationship</a>.</p><h3>12. Don't act desperate</h3><p class=align-left>Don't rush into expressing your feelings when you have feelings for someone. It's not an emergency.

Focus on releasing their dopamine</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/257ab4370ecaebc5.jpeg><p class=align-left>Dopamine is the chemical that gives people pleasure.

Physical touch</h3><p class=align-left>Touching reawakens romantic feelings when done the right way. Find a clever way to touch their arm when you talk gently. This will hint to them that you like them more than just friends.</p><h3>16. Know their romantic standards</h3><p class=align-left>Everyone has romantic standards, especially girls.
