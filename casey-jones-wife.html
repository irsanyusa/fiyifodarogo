The engine approached a spot where a freight train was moving off the track into a siding; Jones saw that it was moving off the main rail too slowly, that his train wouldn’t be able to miss the end of the freight train. Jones hit the brakes but it was too late. He ordered his co-worker to jump but wouldn’t abandon the train himself. He died in the crash and one of his co-workers was so upset that he wrote a song about Jones. Meanwhile his wife, according to one version of the song, told her distraught children to stop crying over the news, because they had “another papa on the Salt Lake Line.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That brief coda to the song was, in reality, a long epilogue to the true story of Casey Jones.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the years following her husband’s untimely death, Mrs. Casey Jones appeared several times in the pages of TIME, and in the early years the magazine often took a semi-snarky tone when it came to her doings. In 1928, for example, she <a href=# rel=noopener>filed a lawsuit </a>against a movie studio that was planning to make a Casey Jones movie without her permission. In 1934, she <a href=# rel=noopener>made news</a> by participating in a ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the railroad in the region.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Widow Jones,” who the magazine had noted “looks well and buxom,” later <a href=# rel=noopener>called</a> that TIME story “a conglomeration of lies.” (For example, Engine No. 638 was not in fact the number of the train on which Casey Jones died.) In her letter to the editor, she warned TIME to never again attempt to write about the Casey Jones story without her permission.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At first, the litigious widow who tries to stop a magazine from writing about her world-famous husband hardly seems worthy of serious consideration. But, to her, correcting errors about Casey Jones had been no laughing matter. Though her husband had died a hero’s death, she lived for nearly six more decades, world famous for a baseless allegation that she had not been faithful. In 1958, when she died, TIME finally set the record straight:</p><figure class=text-left readability=36.5><p>That legend was a legacy of bitterness to Janie Jones, Casey’s wife, mother of his daughter and two sons. For the next 58 years she lived with The Ballad of Casey Jones—and with the cruel lines added to a Negro engine wiper’s mournful song by a Tin Pan Alley hack. “The Casey Jones song has haunted my whole life since the beginning of the century,” she once said. Memphis railroaders were known to fight with strangers who sang the slanderous lines. For a while, the ballad was banned in Jackson, Tenn., where Janie Jones lived out the long, lean years. With the help of a ghost writer, she tried to clear herself in a new version of the song: “My Casey, Husband Casey, who meant the world to me.”</p><p>It was no use. Thousands who never knew that Casey Jones had actually existed still sang of him—and of the other papa on the Salt Lake Line. And last week, impoverished and bitter, Janie Jones, 92, died in Jackson. She had never remarried.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read the full 1958 story, here in the TIME Vault: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>The Legacy of a Legend</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZscGJtgHV%2BjpyYrJ2pYrewusSsZLChlpp8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcasey-jones-wife.html&text=The%20Ballad%20of%20Casey%20Jones%20and%20Its%20Coda%3a%20The%20True%20Story%20of%20His%20Widow&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcasey-jones-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcasey-jones-wife.html&title=The%20Ballad%20of%20Casey%20Jones%20and%20Its%20Coda%3a%20The%20True%20Story%20of%20His%20Widow" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcasey-jones-wife.html&title=The%20Ballad%20of%20Casey%20Jones%20and%20Its%20Coda%3a%20The%20True%20Story%20of%20His%20Widow" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcasey-jones-wife.html&title=The%20Ballad%20of%20Casey%20Jones%20and%20Its%20Coda%3a%20The%20True%20Story%20of%20His%20Widow" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcasey-jones-wife.html&description=The%20Ballad%20of%20Casey%20Jones%20and%20Its%20Coda%3a%20The%20True%20Story%20of%20His%20Widow" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./top-5-agt-acts-who-brought-something-new-to-the-table.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top 5 'AGT' Acts Who Brought Something New to the Table">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./49038-more-than-a-third-of-women-under-40-have-received-unsolicited-sexual-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="More than a third of women under 40 have received unsolicited sexual photos">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
