The government said it arrested hundreds of protesters and Venezuela-based human rights organization Foro Penal said 11 people were killed. Dozens more were arrested the following day, including a former opposition candidate, Freddy Superlano.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Opposition leader María Corina Machado—who was barred from running for president—and González addressed a huge rally of their supporters in the capital, Caracas, on Tuesday, but they have not been seen in public since. Later that day, the president of the National Assembly, Jorge Rodriguez, called for their arrest, calling them criminals and fascists.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro Says Opposition Should Be Jailed at Least 30 Years</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an op-ed published Thursday in the Wall Street Journal, Machado said she is “hiding, fearing for my life, my freedom, and that of my fellow countrymen.” She reasserted that the opposition has physical evidence that Maduro lost the election and urged the international community to intervene.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We have voted Mr. Maduro out,” she wrote. “Now it is up to the international community to decide whether to tolerate a demonstrably illegitimate government.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Government repression over the years has pushed opposition leaders into exile. After the op-ed was published, Machado’s team told the AP that she was “sheltering.” Machado later posted a video on social media calling on supporters to gather Saturday across the country.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The González campaign had no comment on the op-ed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Wednesday, Maduro asked Venezuela’s highest court to conduct an audit of the election, but that request drew almost immediate criticism from foreign observers who said the court is too close to the government to produce an independent review.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Venezuela’s Supreme Tribunal of Justice is closely aligned with Maduro’s government. The court’s justices are nominated by federal officials and ratified by the National Assembly, which is dominated by Maduro sympathizers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Thursday, the court accepted Maduro’s request for an audit and ordered him, González and the eight other candidates who participated in the presidential election to appear before the justices Friday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">González and Machado say they obtained more than two-thirds of the tally sheets printed from electronic voting machine after the polls closed. They said the release of the data on those tallies would prove Maduro lost.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Asked why electoral authorities have not released detailed vote counts, Maduro said the National Electoral Council has come under attack, including cyber-attacks, without elaborating.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The presidents of Colombia and Brazil—both close allies of the Venezuelan government—have urged Maduro to release detailed vote counts.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Brazilian official said the diplomatic efforts are only intended to promote dialogue among Venezuelan stakeholders to negotiate a solution to the disputed election. The official said this would include the release of voting data and allowing independent verification.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">López Obrador said Mexico hopes the will of Venezuela’s people will be respected and that there’s no violence. He added that Mexico expects “that the evidence, the electoral results records, be presented.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pressure has been building on the president since the election.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The National Electoral Council, which is loyal to Maduro’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela, has yet to release any results broken down by voting machine, as it did in past elections. It did, however, report that Maduro received 5.1 million votes, versus more than 4.4 million for González. But Machado, the opposition leader, has said vote tallies show González received roughly 6.2 million votes compared with 2.7 million for Maduro.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Venezuela has the world’s largest proven crude reserves and once boasted Latin America’s most advanced economy, but it entered into free fall after Maduro took the helm in 2013. Plummeting oil prices, widespread shortages and hyperinflation that soared past 130,000% led to social unrest and mass emigration.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014, the largest exodus in Latin America’s recent history.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">—Sá Pessoa reported from Sao Paulo.
