It&nbsp;has been stored there for centuries, but no&nbsp;one managed to&nbsp;take it&nbsp;away from this island. Treasure hunters have been bewitched with this place since 1795. Many people have tried their luck looking for the treasure that could be&nbsp;hidden there by&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Spanish data-link=tag>Spanish</a> pirates or&nbsp;even by&nbsp;the Knights Templar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/297/0b4/4a181f53e9a51baa8c19fcc69c.png><p>But today it’s impossible to&nbsp;get there, as&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;private place, so&nbsp;all you can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;book an&nbsp;ocean tour around this island. Otherwise, you can take a&nbsp;peek at&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV reality show starring the Lagina brothers, Rick and Marty, who are a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;enthusiasts looking for the treasures of&nbsp;Oak Island in&nbsp;Nova Scotia, <a href=# title=Canada data-link=tag>Canada</a>. Yeah, seems like there’s no&nbsp;place where&nbsp;TV producers can’t get&nbsp;to.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the most famous discoveries out there was the so-called Money Pit. Despite the promising name, it&nbsp;wasn’t full of&nbsp;money. Now we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;jump to&nbsp;200 years ago. The Money Pit was first found by&nbsp;a&nbsp;16-year-old kid in&nbsp;1795.</p><p>One day, Daniel McGinnis went fishing at&nbsp;Oak Island. He&nbsp;saw a&nbsp;tree there&nbsp;— unsurprisingly, it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;oak, and it&nbsp;had weird markings. They didn’t seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;natural, so&nbsp;Daniel decided to&nbsp;check the area. He&nbsp;then saw a&nbsp;sunken patch of&nbsp;ground and started digging immediately. His two friends helped him out. But instead of&nbsp;treasures the guys only found logs placed underground at&nbsp;regular intervals. It&nbsp;looked like a&nbsp;place where someone could hide money or&nbsp;jewels, but nothing precious was found.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5ed/e4f/38e05e511b8c349dd4c972e2bb.png><p>However, there was something curious down that pit. Someone found a&nbsp;granite stone there, and it&nbsp;had an&nbsp;engraved inscription on&nbsp;it. There were many attempts to&nbsp;decode&nbsp;it, but most of&nbsp;them ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;failure. There’s one translation though, and it&nbsp;says “forty feet below, two million pounds are buried”. Yeah, McGinnis and his friends should have dug harder.</p><p>The next fun thing about the Money Pit is&nbsp;the coconut fiber found down there. They say that large amounts of&nbsp;this fiber were found at&nbsp;a&nbsp;depth of&nbsp;60&nbsp;feet. It&nbsp;may not surprise you, but&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;remind you of&nbsp;one thing: Oak Island is&nbsp;in&nbsp;Nova Scotia, Canada. Coconut trees do&nbsp;not grow there. The nearest one is&nbsp;about 1,500 miles from Nova Scotia, which makes it&nbsp;obvious that someone brought this fiber purposefully. Researchers came up&nbsp;with an&nbsp;idea that coconut fiber could have been used to&nbsp;make ropes and lower all the treasures down the pit.</p><p>Next&nbsp;up, we&nbsp;have not one but two mysteries. In&nbsp;the late 1800s, the Oak Island Treasure Company was thoroughly inspecting and excavating the island. Everyone believed something enormous was hidden there. These guys managed to&nbsp;drill 153 feet underground&nbsp;— it’s like 15&nbsp;stop signs stacked one on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;another. You might have guessed they didn’t find pounds of&nbsp;gold and diamonds.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/77b/670/948d725f3dbd04ab4c2e79b1a0.png><p>But they found a&nbsp;manuscript. There’s a&nbsp;theory claiming it’s one of&nbsp;Shakespeare’s lost manuscripts. Some scientists believe that it&nbsp;was hidden there by&nbsp;the writer and scientist Francis Bacon, the true author of&nbsp;Shakespeare’s works. Yeah, rumor has&nbsp;it, it&nbsp;was Francis and not Wiliam who wrote all the plays and sonnets. But there’s no&nbsp;proof it&nbsp;was really&nbsp;so.</p><p>The Money Pit may be&nbsp;the most popular shaft on&nbsp;Oak Island, but it’s not the only one and it’s not the first. Before the Money Pit discovery, the treasure hunters were drilling at&nbsp;Smith’s Cove. While damming there, they found a&nbsp;wooden piece. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;U-shaped formation that had Roman numerals. After a&nbsp;more thorough inspection, the specialists realized it&nbsp;was supposedly dated to&nbsp;1769. The Money Pit was discovered 26&nbsp;years later. This fact created many speculations that this structure might have been part of&nbsp;the real shaft with treasures everyone was looking for.</p><p>Now, look at&nbsp;this Templar coin. It&nbsp;wasn’t the first discovery on&nbsp;the island, but it&nbsp;was crucial in&nbsp;some way. Even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;may not sound like a&nbsp;big deal today, in&nbsp;Medieval times those coins would amass an&nbsp;insane amount of&nbsp;wealth. They were typically stored in&nbsp;European fortresses. For the treasure hunters this coin was a&nbsp;sure sign there was more to&nbsp;be&nbsp;found on&nbsp;the island.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2d2/316/9c7a3b59a2b662f8a7089eb7c4.png><p>The logic is&nbsp;simple: if&nbsp;there’s one coin of&nbsp;that kind, there must be&nbsp;something else. And they were right, it&nbsp;wasn’t the only Templar discovery. On&nbsp;the southwest shore of&nbsp;the island, a&nbsp;Crossbow bolt was found. The experts say it&nbsp;dates back to&nbsp;the 13th century. But once again, that wasn’t something the treasure hunters were after! Some more coins were found on&nbsp;the island. Rick and Marty Lagina retrieved this precious piece from a&nbsp;swamp. The coin is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;copper, and this time it&nbsp;originated from Spain.</p><p>When it&nbsp;was found, the Lagina brothers could only see the number “8” engraved on&nbsp;it. But later&nbsp;on, some experts studied this coin and claimed it&nbsp;was made sometime around the 17th century. They managed to&nbsp;clean it&nbsp;well and saw the date 1652 engraved on&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;this coin. There’s a&nbsp;theory stating that Spanish explorers found some treasure but hid it&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;taking it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the King. So&nbsp;maybe, this coin just dropped out of&nbsp;the chest full of&nbsp;coins and jewels and is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the treasure everyone was after. Or&nbsp;someone could have accidentally lost it&nbsp;while looking for the treasure. Who knows?</p><p>One more famous treasure hunter is&nbsp;Gary Drayton. Gary and his team together with Rick Lagina came across two coins while metal-detecting the island. Those were 17th-century King Charles II&nbsp;Britannia coins. One of&nbsp;them had a&nbsp;very clear inscription on&nbsp;it, stating that the coin was minted back in&nbsp;1771.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/447/492/c990c1516798f96fafd13f537f.png><p>Another swamp treasure of&nbsp;possibly Spanish origin is&nbsp;also here! This time it’s a&nbsp;silver ring. A&nbsp;specialist studied it&nbsp;closely and reported that it&nbsp;had been repaired twice. The ring was once made bigger, and it&nbsp;was also made smaller once. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;decorated with a&nbsp;floral design, which was popular in&nbsp;Europe in&nbsp;the 1730s.</p><p>Among all the other curious things, Rick and Marty Lagina found a&nbsp;silver button at&nbsp;Isaac point. The button’s pretty old&nbsp;— it&nbsp;supposedly dates back to&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the 18th century, and the notorious Money Pit was discovered later. This is&nbsp;why it&nbsp;wasn’t a&nbsp;big deal of&nbsp;a&nbsp;find: it&nbsp;could simply belong to&nbsp;some farmer peacefully raising livestock on&nbsp;the island. There’s no&nbsp;official record of&nbsp;any chest full of&nbsp;gems and coins found on&nbsp;Oak Island, but enthusiasts did find some jewels there.</p><p>First off, the team found a&nbsp;brooch with a&nbsp;magnificent red gem. They mistakenly thought it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;ruby, but a&nbsp;professional gemologist stated it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;garnet. The piece was made of&nbsp;silver, and it’s pretty old. Experts believe it&nbsp;was made around the 15&nbsp;or 1600s.</p><p>Another brooch they found didn’t have any gems on&nbsp;it, but it&nbsp;had an&nbsp;intricate design. It’s a&nbsp;brooch with a&nbsp;leaf design and an&nbsp;ornate rope. There are 13&nbsp;branches of&nbsp;the leaf, which instantly created more mystery to&nbsp;the whole treasure hunting. First off, there’s a&nbsp;carving with a&nbsp;13-branched tree on&nbsp;a&nbsp;rock on&nbsp;the north shore of&nbsp;this island. What’s more, many people believe that the number 13&nbsp;is important to&nbsp;the Knights Templar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bb9/42e/f60f5950ab9e7a404a515aebf9.png><p>The enthusiasts also found a&nbsp;brooch not far away from the place where Daniel McGinnis, the guy who found the Money Pit, lived. The brooch was shown to&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional gemologist Charles Lewton-Brain. He&nbsp;had to&nbsp;break it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the team that there were no&nbsp;gems adorning this piece of&nbsp;jewelry. In&nbsp;fact, the stone that seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;gem was just a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;glass.</p><p>It&nbsp;was processed using a&nbsp;special technique though, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was leaded glass. The enthusiasts decided to&nbsp;study the brooch even more and found out that part of&nbsp;the brooch was made of&nbsp;gold. The specialists claim that the brooch dates back to&nbsp;the 14th century. Was it&nbsp;the treasure everyone was looking for?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGptdJmp6WZk5p6qr%2BMn6ylpF2ks268yKuYrZ1dnLytsIywn7Jlk5a7tXnNqGSoppVis6q6w2agrWVoZoNygJJo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthis-place-is-full-of-pirate-gold-why-cant-no-one-find-it-816143.html&text=This%20Place%20Is%20Full%20of%20Pirate%20Gold%2c%20Why%20Cant%20No%20One%20Find%20It%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthis-place-is-full-of-pirate-gold-why-cant-no-one-find-it-816143.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthis-place-is-full-of-pirate-gold-why-cant-no-one-find-it-816143.html&title=This%20Place%20Is%20Full%20of%20Pirate%20Gold%2c%20Why%20Cant%20No%20One%20Find%20It%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthis-place-is-full-of-pirate-gold-why-cant-no-one-find-it-816143.html&title=This%20Place%20Is%20Full%20of%20Pirate%20Gold%2c%20Why%20Cant%20No%20One%20Find%20It%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthis-place-is-full-of-pirate-gold-why-cant-no-one-find-it-816143.html&title=This%20Place%20Is%20Full%20of%20Pirate%20Gold%2c%20Why%20Cant%20No%20One%20Find%20It%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthis-place-is-full-of-pirate-gold-why-cant-no-one-find-it-816143.html&description=This%20Place%20Is%20Full%20of%20Pirate%20Gold%2c%20Why%20Cant%20No%20One%20Find%20It%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./finance-blue-apron-is-slipping-after-laying-off-hundreds-of-workers-aprn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Blue Apron is slipping after laying off hundreds of workers (APRN)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./maya-angelou-mlk-memorial-quote-makes-him-seem-like-an-egotist.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maya Angelou: MLK Memorial Quote Makes Him Seem Like an Egotist">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
