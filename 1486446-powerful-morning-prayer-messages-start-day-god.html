You are full of grace and mercy. I praise you for allowing me to spend another day with my family. I plead with you to protect us. I <a href=#>love you</a>, Father! Amen.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Minister Theophilus Sunday</a>, the organizer and host of the True Worshippers Concert, shared his insights during a conversation with Legit.ng about the most impactful morning prayer, he said:</p>I often see its sacredness, and what I pray is this: "Lord, yesterday is gone, help me live today." That, I think, is an effective way to begin a new day, because it is in Him, the Bible says, we live, move, and have our being.The Lord wants us to see what He sees and hear what He hears. So, it is in the best interest of Christians to pray so that we can see from God's perspective. Because when we see from His perspective, we will be able to live in His perspective, and the scripture explains it as good and not evil, to bring us a future and a desired end (Jeremiah 29:11). <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3896adc7aca08572.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Happy New Year prayer for your partner, family and friends</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Minister Sunday also stressed the importance of integrating scriptures into prayer, explaining that it was the method by which Jesus Christ conquered the devil's temptation. He said:</p>In prayers of warfare, sometimes, I say to God, "it is written, 'Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?' But thus saith the LORD, 'Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children'" (Isaiah 49:24-26). When I do so, it brings God to remembrance of His word, that He has promised won't return to Him void, and I am rest assured that He takes over the battle.<h2>How do you say a simple morning prayer?</h2><p class=align-left>Dear Almighty, help me make you a priority every morning. It makes a huge difference whenever I put you first every day. Awaken my body and spirit with a desire to speak to and hear from you throughout the day. In Jesus' name, I pray, Amen.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fe8485a8dce33d27.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ New year spiritual quotes to send to your loved ones</span></p></a><h2>What is the first prayer of the day?</h2><p class=align-left>Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for my family and pray you to help us love each other unconditionally, even in our weaknesses.
