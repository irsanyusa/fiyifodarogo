The country is well known around the world for Oktoberfest, its two-week festival which is visited by people from all corners of the world eager to drink local beer and get a taste of German tradition and heritage.&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oktoberfest</a></strong>&nbsp;– also known as Wiesn – is the most famous German tradition, but there are several lesser-known traditional occasions that are just as interesting as well as more original. Here are 8 of our favourite authentic German traditions which native Germans hold dear.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Authentic German Traditions</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1.&nbsp;Schultüte&nbsp;on the first day of school</h3><p>The&nbsp;Schultüte&nbsp;is a traditional German gift that was established during the 19th century. A Schultüte is a paper or plastic bag in the shape of a large cone. They are given by parents to their children on their very first day of school (after Kindergarten) to help them overcome the anxiety that is normally associated with this milestone. Schultüten are usually filled with various small gifts ranging from candy to items of clothing and teddy bears.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Fireworks on New Year’s Eve</h3><p>“But there are fireworks everywhere on New Year’s Eve,” you might be thinking. However, be assured that German people take their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NYE Fireworks</a> very seriously. Come December 31 (or even a few days earlier), 90% of the German population aged 5-95 seem to have turned into experienced pyrotechnists and start setting off fireworks in every direction and at any time of the day or night. This is especially scary once the clock strikes midnight, but doesn’t seem to cause major hazards and this tradition is still going strong!&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Watching “Dinner For One’ on New Year’s Eve</h3><p>Another interesting German New Year’s Eve tradition is called Dinner For One. Ever heard of it? This 1963 English comedy sketch has been airing on TV on New Year’s Eve since the 1960s and has been shown 231 times in total. If you want to impress a German friend, just try to include the cult quote “The same procedure as last year?“ – “The same procedure as every year“ in a conversation. This sketch holds a world record for the most frequently repeated TV program in the world but it has never been aired in the UK or the US. Its success in Germany remains a mystery, but&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">you can watch the 11-minute video here</a></strong>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Reinfeiern</h3><p>In Germany, celebrating birthdays is taken very seriously. A German tradition regarding this is described by the verb reinfeiern, which literally means “party into” and is used in the phrase in den Geburtstag reinfeiern. It refers to the act of celebrating one’s birthday the evening before, considering that the person’s birthday will start as soon as the clock strikes midnight. That way, the&nbsp;Geburtstagkind&nbsp;(literally ‘birthday kid’) is surrounded by his or her loved ones for the first few minutes or hours of his or her birthday.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Karneval</h3><p>When hearing the word carnival, one is likely to start thinking of Rio de Janeiro and Venice first, but Germany also has a strong carnival culture! Carnival season starts in November and peaks on&nbsp;Rosenmontag&nbsp;(Rose Monday) which usually falls on February or early March, two days before Ash Wednesday. Carnival is mostly celebrated in Cologne, Mainz, and Düsseldorf, but many German regions also celebrate it on and around Rosenmontag. Carnival processions are held and people celebrate on the street <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in costumes</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. Tanz in den Mai</h3><p>Tanz in den Mai, literally “dance into May” is the name of most parties taking place every year on April 30. This celebration originates from&nbsp;Walpurgisnacht&nbsp;(or&nbsp;Hexennacht, meaning Witches Night), which was the night to get rid of evil spirits and celebrate the arrival of spring. Nowadays, most clubs and bars host special parties and people also often dance around bonfires in parks. May 1 is also highly celebrated in Germany as it is Labor Day. In Berlin, for example, several demonstrations take place and the neighborhood of Kreuzberg turns into a big street festival with open-air stages hosting free concerts.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>7. Tanzverbot</h3><p>Tanzverbot&nbsp;means “dancing ban” and is a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">term</a> that is used to describe the fact that dancing on some holidays is forbidden by state governments. Dancing bans are mostly linked to Christian holidays such as Good Friday as well as memorial days like&nbsp;Volkstrauertag,&nbsp;which commemorates those who died during armed conflicts or from oppression.</p><p>This dancing ban concerns public dancing parties but people are free to dance in their homes. In practice, this means that some places dedicated to dancing such as clubs have to stay shut during the agreed period. In Berlin for example, clubs are supposed to be closed between 4 am and 9 pm on Good Friday.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>8. Tatort</h3><p>As a&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">foreigner living in Germany</a></strong>, you can consider yourself truly integrated the first time a friend invites you over to watch&nbsp;Tatort. This crime TV series has been airing since the 1970s and is the biggest Sunday evening tradition in Germany. The show is based on stories happening to different police units in different cities (each episode takes place in one of around 20 German, Swiss and Austrian cities and revolves around a single crime). Public screenings of the show are often held in bars and people also like to gather at home to watch the weekly episode.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Lingoda Team</h2><p>This article was produced by one of the in-house Lingoda writers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXNoKadmV6YvK57waWmoGeVo3yosdGmmKdlpKeupbXToqanq18%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgerman-traditions.html&text=German%20traditions%20explained%20-%20Lingoda&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgerman-traditions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgerman-traditions.html&title=German%20traditions%20explained%20-%20Lingoda" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgerman-traditions.html&title=German%20traditions%20explained%20-%20Lingoda" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgerman-traditions.html&title=German%20traditions%20explained%20-%20Lingoda" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgerman-traditions.html&description=German%20traditions%20explained%20-%20Lingoda" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./obituary-irish-character-actor-derrick-oconnor-1202864783.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Irish Character Actor Derrick OConnor Dies at 77">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./books-trudge-into-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Books: Trudge into History | TIME">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
