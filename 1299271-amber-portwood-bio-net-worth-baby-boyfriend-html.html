She lived with her parents, Tonya and Shawn, as well as her brother Shawn Jr. Her younger sister Candace passed away when she was a baby.</p><p class=align-left>The girl's young years were not easy, because her mother reportedly abandoned her most of the time and had an extramarital affair.</p><p class=align-left>She first became prominent on the show <i>"16 and Pregnant"</i>, where she was one of the regular stars. The series depicted her struggles to adapt to being a teenage mother, as well as her turbulent relationship with her boyfriend Gary Shirley, who made Amber Portwood pregnant.

Later, they split, and Gary found a new wife named Kristina Anderson.</p><p class=align-left>After that, the teen mom had a few short-lived relationships, but her next serious one was with Matt Baier. Amber Portwood and Matt Baier were together for more than three years, and their union was not very healthy either, with their mutual accusations of abuse. They also split up a few times before getting back together.</p><p class=align-left>From 2017 to 2019, the star was in a relationship with Andrew Glennon. With this man, she became a mother for a second time.

There was a controversy about the female star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">threatening her boyfriend</a> with a machete and being violent towards him when their little son was near. Eventually, the two parted ways and got engaged in a custody battle with each other.</p><p class=align-left>In December 2019, reports came out that the former star had found a new boyfriend, a Belgian native called Dimitri Garcia. He was a fan of the <i>"Teen Mom"</i> show, and they met through social media.
