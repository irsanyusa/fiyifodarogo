The communal <i>Salat ul-Eid </i>prayers follow this recitation.</li><li>During the festival, all Muslims regardless of age and gender wear their best clothes. Often, people wear new clothes. In Nigeria, for example, men wear their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">best Agbada</a>. People then go the mosque for prayers where they thank Allah for all the blessings that He has given them. Usually, the greeting of <i>Eid Mubarak</i> is exchanged and gifts may also be exchanged.</li><li>Communal prayers are said before midday. Only after these prayers is the animal slaughtered. When this is not followed, the slaughter becomes unacceptable.</li><li>Once the sacrifice is made and the meat is divided according to the rules, regulations and traditions, people can prepare the meat as they like. The recipes used vary from one country to another. In South-East Asia, for instance, biryani is prepared, while in Turkey, Turkish kebabs may be prepared with the meat. In Nigeria, meat curries are often made. To accompany the meat, various yummy dishes are prepared depending on personal or family preferences.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a7b343336dbbfef4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is Eid al-Adha and why do we celebrate it?
